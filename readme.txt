Description
===========

A simple, easy to use plain text file-based, task management, web application.
It offers superb ways of filtering, grouping, searching for and managing your tasks.
But ultimately 'all you tasks belong you', so everything is stored in a straight forward text file format.
(Just like this file!)
Tasks are created and edited directly in the text file, either in the application or in an editor of your choice.
*NEW*: finally you can drag and drop tasks in default view to re-order them!

There's plenty of help information in the help.html, faq.html, and search-help.html files;
sometimes it's worth reading the manuals, they are not that long!

All credit goes to the original Taskpaper application for the inspiration and ideas...but no code!


Credits
=======

All modern software is written "standing on the shoulders of giants",
thanks to many helpful manual writers, help/FAQ/blog pages, and
a wealth of ideas and tips obtained from others on the web (got to love Stack Overflow!),
and hours of 'Googling' which made this application possible.  Many thanks for sharing!

Including but not restricted to:
  - Hogbay's Taskpaper (original idea)
  - Taskpaper.web (the motivation)
  - jQuery plus jEditable, jAddress, jHotKeys; and jQuery.ui (wonderful tools)
  - the Perfect 3-column Layout
  - the simple PHP Template engine (heavily customised)
  - Crystal Clear icon set by Everaldo Coelho

Plus some wonderful tools:
  - PHP 5.3
  - Fossil SCM version control---if you are a lonely little developer like me then this VCS is simply great!
  - Console2 (to manage Fossil)
  - Netbeans 7.0 beta IDE
  - Firebug 1.7
  - FullSync (a very simple build tool...)
  - Notepad++ (testing php functions, and writing help files)
  - oh, and Firefox 3.6 of course... where would we be without that! (thought I'm running it fine in FF4 for the forerunners out there)
  - Chrome (yes, tp+ runs very well on Chrome too), and I believe Opera too...
