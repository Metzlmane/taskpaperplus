UPGRADING FROM ANY VERSION BEFORE 0.9.0
=======================================
Version 0.9.0 was a major update to Taskpaper+ and brings along with it some significant internal changes to the program.  There are many new, deleted, and changed files, hence it is not possible to update by simply copying the new files over the top of your current installation as was the case before.

Instead: rename the your current taskpaper folder, and then create a new taskpaper using the new 0.9.0 version, then copy over the contents of your 'data' folder.  Start 'Taskpaper+' and all should be well...

BREAKING CHANGES
================
All improvements bring changes, however minor they may be.  In the this release a few small things had to be changed to allow, what I feel to be, better functionality:

  1.  When adding tasks from the task box, you MUST put a space after the -. If not the task will be treated as an excluded word search instead.
  2.  The action highlighting asterisks (*) must have a space in front of them to avoid confusion with the bold formatting syntax
  3.  The prefix for time-period 'tags', like @today, @2week has been changed to =, i.e. =today, =2week.  This avoids ambiguity with 'word' tags, for example @tom (the person) vs. @tom (tomorrow) => =tom
  4.  It also means that you can use the =today, =tomorrow syntax in the full edit box and have the real date substituted as well
  5.  Deleted items now go to a separate "Deleted" taskpaper.  No more inadvertent losses!
